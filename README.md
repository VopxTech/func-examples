# Func Examples

An evergrowing collection of examples of how to use the smart-contract language of The Open Network: **func**.

Our mission is to adapt ALL code snippets from the [FunC Cookbook](https://docs.ton.org/develop/func/cookbook) into runnable [Blueprint](https://github.com/ton-org/blueprint) projects.
